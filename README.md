# Coursera DataSet
This project analyzes a dataset of Coursera courses to explore a key hypothesis about course difficulty, ratings, and enrollment trends.

## Hypothesis: Courses labeled as "non-beginner" have higher average ratings and enrollment numbers than beginner-level courses.
To test this, I focused on the following features:

- course_rating

- course_difficulty

- course_students_enrolled

# DataSet
This dataset contains 891 records and 7 features.  
In this 7 features are the following:  
- Unnamed: 0                   
- course_title                 
- course_organization          
- course_Certificate_type      
- course_rating               
- course_difficulty            
 -course_students_enrolled
